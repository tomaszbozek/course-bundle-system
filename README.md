# course-bundle-system

I prepared two implementations:

- imperative and more structural solution
- object-oriented based on imperative

- I thought it would be easier to prepared OO solution and then supported myself with imperative one
but since I found some issues with algorithm - my results do not match that ones in task I wasn't able to do OO properly
- OOO always requires more information about how system will evolve and may not be so elastic as normal code but junits are easier and smaller and it's much more testable 
than using reflection and other hacks ;)
- As you can see imperative is easier and I would stick with it until more knowledge about final solution is built and
  code is well
  covered. Object oriented approach generates too many classes until it's really needed.
- I prepared some set of junits and one integration test
- Application runs as standalone spring boot application

# how to run it?
- run as standalone spring boot application by running from IntelliJ class 'CourseBundleSystemApplication.java'
